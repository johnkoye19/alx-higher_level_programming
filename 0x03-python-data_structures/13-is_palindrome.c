Technical interview preparation:

/**You are not allowed to google anything
/* Whiteboard first
/* Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome.
*/
//how can I do this?
//what if I read through the list?
//how will I keep track of the numbers
//or can I save them in a list as I read through?
//or do we read it in tw parts. the first starts from the head node, while the second starts from the tail node?
//then compare
int is_palindrome(listint_t **head);
Return: 0 if it is not a palindrome, 1 if it is a palindrome
An empty list is considered a palindrome
