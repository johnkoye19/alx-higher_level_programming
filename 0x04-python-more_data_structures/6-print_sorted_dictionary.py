# Write a function that prints a dictionary by ordered keys.


def print_sorted_dictionary(a_dictionary):
for i in sorted(x):
print("{}: {}".format(i, x[i]))
You can assume that all keys are strings
Keys should be sorted by alphabetic order
Only sort keys of the first level (donâ€™t sort keys of a dictionary inside the main dictionary)
Dictionary values can have any type
You are not allowed to import any module
